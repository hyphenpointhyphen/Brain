Based on the taxonomy **Deep learning in the context of artificial intelligence**, the topological structure NN
gives substance/motives of worldly percepts. The coherence and causality is tuned by combination of 
spiking organization.


Hierarchical engramming leads to decrease in power as more abstract engramms allow for more complex representations
which thusly can increase complexity and understanding w.r.t. an evolution-driven perception.

The brain works as an energy-efficiency optimizer that tries to minimize energy expenditure while increasing
the amount of diversity and complexity
